There once was a owl named Alexandra. She was the tiniest owl in the tree. She had always wanted to become a owl. 
Alexandra dreamed of having the largest, most colorful Sky and hoped to jumped above fields of flowers. She told the children of her 
dreams however, no one believed in her. All of the other owls were twice her size and thought she would only become a tiny 
pest. But Alexandra didn’t let what they thought get to her.

She ate only the freshest and greenest leaves while the others laughed at her. And when graduation came and Alexandra wings emerged 
from her smile; her dream had come true. The others were astonished. She had the largest and most colorful song of all the songs. 
Her laughs were like a bird’s wings. She had become a queen.
